I's Got Eyes

This program is a security tool to help monitor people under certain situations. It could be used by an employer or a school to monitor people. Perhaps it could be used by a teacher to prevent students from cheating on a computer-based exam, or maybe an employer wants to evaluate how much copying and pasting an employee does.  It performs the following:

    keylogging;
    records what process it is in
    when something is copied and at what time
    when something is pasted and at what time
    It also provides timestamped screenshots for when things are copied or pasted.


To be clear, this is not intended to be a trojan or malware, but a security tool, so it does not need to hide itself.

I may expand this to include other functionality that would be useful for similar circumstances or to modify the purpose and make it more of a covert tool.

Future work:

    Expand additional functionality. Perhaps make it more multipurpose. Create a list of trigger words that if they are typed, it maybe outputs the next 200-500 characters to a special file associated with that.
    Set up a server/client to send the logs and images periodically.
    Obfuscation.
    Give it more trojan like capabilities.
    Make it more secure - a user couldn't simply delete it.
